  # Fix RLS Policy Infinite Recursion

  This migration fixes the infinite recursion issues in RLS policies by:
  1. Dropping all existing policies that might cause conflicts
  2. Creating simplified policies that avoid recursive references
  3. Ensuring proper policy names that don't conflict with existing ones

  ## Changes Made
  - Removed recursive policy checks that reference the users table
  - Simplified all policies to use basic authenticated user checks
  - Used unique policy names to avoid conflicts
*/
